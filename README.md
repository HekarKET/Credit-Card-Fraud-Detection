# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

## A Neural network model which can predict Credit Card Fraud using Transaction details.
This proejct contains data analysis of famous Credit Card Fraud dataset. Proejct was based on imbalance dataset classification. By performing some tactics to Combat Imbalanced Classes we got 99.9% accuracy.
